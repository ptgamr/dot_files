# My Tmux & Vim configuration

I'm climbing the Vim world. The most frustrated thing until now is to make vim looks nice. However I'm getting there :)

### Tmux must be configured & start differently
- please refer to `.tmux.conf` file to see the `screen-256color` config
- start tmux using : `tmux -2` to force it to run in 256 mode

### Make Tmux bar look nice
Please see my `.tmux.conf` file

### Use vimrc
https://github.com/amix/vimrc

### Vim colorscheme must be aligned with your Terminator (iTerm) profile

I used SpaceGray (https://github.com/ajh17/Spacegray.vim)

So, Terminal color profile has to be set to `Spacegray`
And colorscheme in `.vimrc` must be set to `Spacegray`, too

Cheers
